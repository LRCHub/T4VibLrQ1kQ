Fire in the ice
Bright until the night
Trying to find the light
You know it feels wrong
Past the point of leading on
It wasn't like this all along

"G" was the grass that used to be green
Then "U" stole everything from me
"I" tried hard to ignore your deceit
But "L" is for lies and I found the receipts
"T" was too good to be true
You made me believe I could trust you
"Y" did I think this would be different
Now I know it's guilty until proven innocent

Seasons changed, I fell for you
Little did I know, he fell too
I'm done with your version of the truth
I hope you're happy in the end
Looking back on all you ruined
Breaking us, you lost my trust
Don't ask to stay friends

"G" was the grass that used to be green
Then "U" stole everything from me
"I" tried hard to ignore your deceit
But "L" is for lies and I found the receipts
"T" was too good to be true
You made me believe I could trust you
"Y" did I think this would be different
Now I know it's guilty until proven innocent

The gavel's ringing loud
The session is over
Everybody's walking out
Screw closure
The gavel's ringing loud
You look over your shoulder
You finally walk out
Game over, game over
Game over

"G" was the grass that used to be green
Then "U" stole everything from me
"I" tried hard to ignore your deceit
But "L" is for lies and I found the receipts
"T" was too good to be true
You made me believe I could trust you
"Y" did I think this would be different
Now I know it's guilty until proven innocent

"Y" did I think this would be different
"Y" did I think you would admit it
"Y" did I think this would be different
With "U" it's guilty until proven innocent
