I'm standing in the dark
With my innocent hand on my heart
I've changed my plea
I've changed my plea to guilty
Because freedom is wasted on me
See how you're all spoiled again

Outside there is a pain
Emotional air raids exhaust in my heart
And it's safer to be inside

So, I'm changing my plea
And no one can dissuade me
Because freedom is wasted on me
See how you're all spoiled again

Something I have learned
If there is one thing in life I've observed
It's that everybody's got somebody
Oh no, not me
So I've changed my plea to guilty
And reason and freedom is a waste
It's a lot like life
